# My old C++ codes
Various C++ codes that I done over the years. 


All codes are provided as is. Most of these codes are not commented, some give wrong output, have memory leak, poor coding convention and some are plain wrong.
In order to use select codes, input and output must be inferred directly from code.


For UVA codes use problem number to find input and output. A few of the C++ codes and uva solutions are available in my blogs with comments and explanation.
